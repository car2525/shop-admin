ShopAdmin is an administration platform for managing an online store, built with **Angular**. This project was generated using [Angular CLI version 16.2.16](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) and is configured to support modern technologies like **NgRx** for state management, **PrimeNG** for UI components, and **Chart.js** for data visualization.

## Main Technologies

- **Angular 16.x**: A framework for building modern, reactive web applications.
- **NgRx**: A library for reactive state management, used for managing global state and handling asynchronous operations.
- **PrimeNG**: A UI component library for Angular, featuring a wide range of components like tables, forms, modals, and more.
- **Chart.js**: A library for creating interactive charts and data visualizations.
- **RxJS**: A library for reactive programming, used to manage asynchronous data streams.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
